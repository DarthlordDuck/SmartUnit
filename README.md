SmartUnit is intended to be a place where unit test utility and helper classes can be collected to be shared.

SmartUnit artifacts, including sources and javadocs, are available on the central Maven repository, just add the following dependency to your POM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.agileware</groupId>
  <artifactId>smartunit</artifactId>
  <version>0.6.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
